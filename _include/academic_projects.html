            <br/><h3><i>Term Paper</i><span style="float: right"><i>November 2015</i></span></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 83%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the L<sub>18</sub> (2<sup>1</sup>&times;3<sup>7</sup>) orthogonal array design, 
            experiments were carried out in turning AISI 52100 steel. Five factors each set at three levels and 
            surface roughness models were developed.</p>

            <br/><h3><i>B.Tech Project</i><span style="float: right"><i>April 2015</i></span></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 83%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this work the cutting parameters namely process parameters such as cutting speed,
                feed rate, depth of cut and tool parameters such as nose radius, rake angle are considered as input factors to study their
                effects on responses, surface roughness and material removal rate. In this study, the experiments were carrired out as per
                L<sub>18</sub> orthogonal array design. This study highlights the use of Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), Technique for Order
                Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Principal Component Analysis based TOPSIS (PCA-TOPSIS). 
                Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also used to find out the most influential cutting parameters on to the responses. 
                From the results, It can be observed that PCA-TOPSIS outperformed compared to remaining techniques.</p>
